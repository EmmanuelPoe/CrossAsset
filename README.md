# 💸 CrossAsset Financial Analysis Tool

CrossAsset is a lightweight, local-first Single Page Application (SPA) designed to visualize the correlation between global money supply metrics and various asset classes. 

Comparing metrics like **M2 Money Supply** or **CPI** against assets like **Gold**, **Bitcoin**, and **S&P 500** helps investors understand purchasing power, inflation trends, and macro-driven asset performance over time.

3. Automatically opens your default browser to `http://localhost:8501`.
4. Starts the analysis server.
